2.  Figure out way to make many of one thing without having to name each one.
3.  previous version is too verbose. need to use more iterable items rather than
    a new name for every item. Too inefficient.
4.  "=>" functions 
4.5 Literals -
5.  Callback function - very interesting esp with the passed parameter...
    let a = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four'];

    ass.forEach(function(num){console.log(num)})
6.  Ground shouldnt be repetitive, maybe follow a map?
7.  Fuel and damage bars.
